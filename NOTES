# Exploratory Notes

* Original idea is macos' ptrace_attachext "extension", in which we receive ptrace notifications over a mach port instead of signaling
    * XNU doesn't seem to support syscall interception (with `EXC_SYSCALL`): https://github.com/checkra1n/BugTracker/issues/1137
        * `EXC_SYSCALL` is only referenced when the syscall number is bad: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aapple-oss-distributions%2Fxnu%20EXC_SYSCALL&type=code
        * and `EXC_MACH_SYSCALL` is never referenced
    * XNU also doesn't implement `task_set_emulation` which would let us specify a userland handler for syscalls

    * Potential resolution: sandbox (w/ seatbelt) target with no privs - does this raise an exception back to us that we could then record and somehow continue from?
        * Raises, but the child is killed and we can't undo that
    * Potential resolution: other ways of blocking syscalls
        * `proc_set_syscall_filter_mask`
            * Looks like it'd just skip...
        * AUDIT
            * Not hookable, read-only
    * Potential resolution: dynamic rewriting of syscall and calls to msg_trap
        * Alternative idea: LLDB plugin
            * Reuse LLDB's disasm and everything else to implement dynamic rewriting

* Alternative idea: dtrace
    * Most (simple) data could be extracted as a D script
        * Arbitrary dereferencing can be done with e.g. `*(uint32_t*)copyin(arg0, 4)`
        * Appears this all has to be "serialized" and printed out, no easy way to return a byte array
    * Dtrace is "async" though, which makes dynamic struct walking and whatnot very hard
        * https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/5c2921b07a2480ab43ec66f5b9e41cb872bc554f/bsd/dev/dtrace/systrace.c#L190
    * Idea: is it possible to signal within a dtrace program/handler?
        * Yes! Pass `-w` to enable destructive actions, then `stop();` or `raise(SIGSTOP);`
        * Does this work both on entry and exit?
            * Yes, but the syscall is still evaluated before the signal is delivered
                * https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/5c2921b07a2480ab43ec66f5b9e41cb872bc554f/bsd/dev/dtrace/dtrace.c#L6701


# Current Design
* ptrace with `PT_ATTACHEXC`
* child starts, another thread running dtrace is spun up which causes all syscalls (both unix and mach) to store the syscall number to an aggregation and `raise(SIGSTOP)`
    * libdtrace doesn't expose an easy way to iterate over received principal buffers
        * `dtrace_consume` streams formatted output to a `FILE*`
            * https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/dtrace/blob/05b1f5b12ead47eb14e4712e24a1b1a981498020/lib/libdtrace/common/dt_consume.c#L2667
    * Not ideal, but aggregations work to get a few values out in a simpler way, since those can be snapshot and retrieved in binary form
* sigstop causes ptrace event
* child memory is probed and stored
* PC of syscall is recorded so we know to set breakpoint there in replay
