Quick:
* Allocate for mmap and mach_vm_allocate out of prealloced region
* External effects shouldn't have an address - the args should be pre-munged at record time
* Coalesce continuous changed mem addresses into a single side effect

Bigger:
* How to deal with blocking syscalls
* Thread scheduling

Probably will never get to but for technical completeness:
* "Send" SIGILL/SIGSEGV to target (i.e. jump to handler if registered) if we get a corresponding trap
