Quick:
* Figure out how to best deal with mmap'd files
    * Implicitly rewrite as MAP_ANON + memory writes?

Bigger:
* Thread scheduling
    * How to deal with blocking syscalls

Probably will never get to but for technical completeness:
* "Send" SIGILL/SIGSEGV to target (i.e. jump to handler if registered) if we get a corresponding trap
